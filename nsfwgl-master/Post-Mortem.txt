PostMortem Anlysis

My goals for this project was to have all the requirements met along with some expirementation to delve a bit deeper
into  the concepts and topics covered throughout the lessons.  Last year we created also created graphics renderer
and this project was very helpful in refreshing my memory on OpenGL as well as learning new tools to use such as FBX
and OBJ loading, GPU funcitonality, and shaders.  So far I have met my goals set for myself.  I could have done more 
on playing around with different functions to get different results.    

The one thing that I did and understood really well was lighting.  The concept of using matrix/vector math to objects
to have them render a certain way is easily pictured im my head.  To me, working with shaders is more clear to me
than OpenGL coding.  Debugging shaders are a bit tricky but with right error checking, problems can be more clear.  
Also, with the help of Nsight, the step-through process became easier. 

The thing that became the most difficult for me was refactoring from foward to deffered rendering. It was much
needed because overall, my code becomes messy and unorganized. Also, looking at another person's code and understanding 
the new structure of the framework took a while to grasp. It took a lot of explaining to find out how the functions
work and how its all connected. A lot of help came from Esme and Terry. Some of the problems I had was spotting tiny mistakes like misplelt words. 

In the future I would like to continue reviewing the topics that was covered in this project.  The worst thing that
I can do is learn these topics and forget them later on.  I would also like to  continue working on these topics more 
in depth.
