	This file contains a BASE CLASS for a Render Pass object.

	The RenderPass object will use a shader to write
	some such number of objects to some FBO that it keeps track of.

	
	*** You should inherit from this class, implementing the prep, draw, and post functions.

	*** You should also implement the setUniform function, to make future passes
	a little easier to work with.
